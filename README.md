# Rhost

Rhost will be a Rails blogging engine (inspired by Ghost). The engine will be
installable into any Rails application and provide an interface to write and
manage blog posts.

The Rails application can then use the provided helpers & tools to create the
public-facing views for their blog. It's ideal when you need to integrate your
blog with your existing websites & views.

This is still a work in progress so please check back again soon.
